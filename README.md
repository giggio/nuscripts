# Giovanni Bassi's Nushell files

These are my personal Nushell files.

## Installation instructions

Install Nushell, then run:

```nushell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/giggio/nuscripts.git <your directory>
```

Set a symlink from `config.nu` and `env.nu` to the ones in your directory.

## Completions

Install [carapace-bin](https://github.com/rsteube/carapace-bin) and delete
`scripts/dynamic/carapace-init.nu`. It will be automatically recreated
with the necessary code from carapace-bin.

## Shell prompt

Install [Starship](https://starship.rs).

## Other tools

Install:

* [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)

## Contributing

Questions, comments, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome.  Submit them at
[the project on GitHub](https://github.com/giggio/nuscripts).

Bug reports that include steps-to-reproduce (including code) are the
best. Even better, make them in the form of pull requests.
